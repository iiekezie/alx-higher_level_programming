### Description

This repository encompasses programs developed as part of the alx higher-level programming track at ALX Software Engineering School. These projects commenced during the fourth month of the year one curriculum, providing an opportunity to acquire proficiency in Python, MySQL, and JavaScript. Concurrently, I further fortified and broadened my expertise in C and shell scripting. The repository includes a comprehensive list of the specific projects undertaken during this period.
