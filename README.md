# Higher Level Programming

## 

### Description

A high-level programming language is characterized by a substantial level of abstraction from the intricacies of computer hardware. In sharp contrast to low-level programming languages, high-level languages often incorporate natural language elements, enhancing ease of use. They are designed to automate, and in some cases, conceal complex aspects of computing systems, such as memory management. This characteristic simplifies and enhances the understandability of the program development process compared to using lower-level languages. The degree of abstraction present determines the "high-level" classification of a programming language [1].
