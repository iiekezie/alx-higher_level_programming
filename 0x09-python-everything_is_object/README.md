- All files should end with a newline character.
- The first line of all script files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using wc.
- .txt answer files should have only one line and end with a newline character.
